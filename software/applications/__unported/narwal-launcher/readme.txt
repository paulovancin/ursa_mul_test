This module extends hellfireos capabilities by 
providing dynamic application loading to the 
kernel. The orca-launcher is an application that 
listens for control messages. Such messages can 
spawn and kill tasks remotely. the launcher 
requires the loaded application to be compiled 
separately from the platform (see compilation scripts
for details). In addition to, the app-launcher tool
must be used to load application remotely (see manual).
